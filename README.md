## About the Book


As React has grown, the amazing toolset around it has grown, adding features and enhancing the development workflow. These range from essential third-party tools, such as Jest for carrying out testing, to official first-party tools, such as create-react-app that most developers use for bootstrapping new React applications. React 16 Tooling covers in detail the most important tools, utilities and libraries that every React developer needs to know. These will make your development life simpler and happier, enabling you to create better and more performant apps.

React 16 Tooling presents a hand-picked selection of the best tools for the React 16 ecosystem. For starters, there’s the create-react-app utility that’s officially supported by the React team. Not only does this tool bootstrap your React project for you, it also provides a consistent and stable framework to build upon. The premise is that when you don’t have to think about meta development work, more focus goes into the product itself.

Other React tools follow this same approach to automating and improving your development life. Jest makes unit testing easier. The React devtools browser plugin makes debugging components easier. Flow makes catching common type errors easy. Storybook makes developing components in isolation easier. ESLint makes writing standardized quality React code easier. Docker containers make deploying React applications in a stack easier.In this book, we’ll look at each of these powerful tools in detail, showing you how to build the perfect React ecosystem to develop your apps within.

## Instructions and Navigation
All of the code is organized into folders. Each folder starts with a number followed by the application name. For example, Chapter02.
